# Documentation Rules

## Workflow Types

### Review Workflow
When user shares content for review:

1. **Analyze** the provided content thoroughly
2. **Make changes directly** in the target files with clear explanations
3. **User can apply or revert** changes using Cursor's diff interface
4. **Explain the changes made** and reasoning behind each modification
5. **Allow selective approval** - user can accept some changes and reject others

### Update Workflow  
When user requests updates based on examples:

1. **Study the provided example** to understand patterns and structure
2. **Identify target pages** that need updates or creation
3. **Ensure consistency** across all related documentation
4. **Update existing pages** or create new ones as specified
5. **Maintain uniform formatting** and style throughout

## Essential Formatting
- Use clear, descriptive titles with `#` (H1)
- Use hierarchical headings (`##`, `###`) to organize content
- **Always include an empty line after a colon (`:`) when followed by a list** - Required for proper MkDocs rendering
- Use triple backticks with language specification: ```rust, ```bash, ```toml
- Use admonitions for important information: `!!! warning "Title"`, `!!! note "Title"`

## Writing Style
- Professional, technical tone without condescension
- Clear, concise explanations
- Concrete examples with expected output
- Minimal, focused examples - no bloat
- Fewer emojis for professional tone

## Code Examples
- Complete and runnable
- Include comments for key concepts
- Show both input and expected output when relevant
- Test examples before including them

## File Organization
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `getting-started.md`
- Use `index.md` for section landing pages
- Group related files in subdirectories

## Critical List Formatting Rule

**MANDATORY**: Every list preceded by a colon (`:`) MUST have an empty line between the colon and the first list item.

**Correct** (empty line after colon):
```markdown
**Parameters:**

- `program` - Description
- `accounts` - Account information
- `data` - Instruction data
```

**Incorrect** (no empty line):
```markdown
**Parameters:**
- `program` - Description
- `accounts` - Account information
```

**Examples of patterns requiring empty lines:**

```markdown
Available options:

- Option A
- Option B

Required fields:

- Field 1
- Field 2

The following steps:

1. Step one
2. Step two
```

## Review Process
When reviewing documentation:

1. **Grammar and Spelling**: Fix all errors immediately
2. **List Formatting**: Ensure empty lines after colons before lists
3. **Structure and Clarity**: Improve organization and readability  
4. **Consistency**: Maintain uniform style across related pages
5. **Authorization**: For review workflow, propose changes and wait for approval
6. **Implementation**: For update workflow, implement changes directly while ensuring consistency
