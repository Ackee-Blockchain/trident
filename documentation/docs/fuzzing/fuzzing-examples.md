- [incorrect-ix-sequence-1](https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/trident/tree/master/examples/fuzz-tests/incorrect-ix-sequence-1)
- [unauthorized-access-2](https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/trident/tree/master/examples/fuzz-tests/unauthorized-access-2)
- [incorrect-integer-arithmetic-3](https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/trident/tree/master/examples/fuzz-tests/incorrect-integer-arithmetic-3)

### Example usage of Arbitrary Trait with Custom Data type as Instruction parameter

### Example usage of limiting the Instruction data structure with the Arbitrary trait
- [arbitrary-limit-inputs-5](https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/trident/tree/master/examples/fuzz-tests/arbitrary-limit-inputs-5)

### Example usage of CPI with available source code to the callee program
- [simple-cpi-6](https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/trident/tree/master/examples/fuzz-tests/simple-cpi-6)


### Example usage of CPI with unavailable source code to the callee program (i.e. callee as SBF)
- [cpi-metaplex-7](https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/trident/tree/master/examples/fuzz-tests/cpi-metaplex-7)
