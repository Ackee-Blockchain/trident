This section summarizes some known limitations in the current development stage. Further development will be focused on resolving these limitations.

- Only fuzzing of one program without CPIs to other custom programs is supported.
- Remaining accounts in check methods are not supported.
- Composite accounts are not supported (however it is possible to generate a fuzz test and finish the composite accounts deserialization manually).
