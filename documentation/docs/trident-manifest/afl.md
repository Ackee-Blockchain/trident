# AFL Configuration

## `run_time`

- Number of seconds this fuzzing session will last.

`(default: 0 [no limit])`

```bash
[afl]
run_time = 0
```

---

## `iterations`

- Number of fuzzing iterations.

`(default: 0 [no limit])`

```bash
[afl]
iterations = 0
```

---

## `cargo_target_dir`

- Target compilation directory, to not clash with cargo build's default target directory.

`(default: "" ["trident-tests/fuzz_tests/fuzzing/afl/afl_target"])`

```bash
[afl]
cargo_target_dir = ""
```

---

## `afl_workspace_in`

- AFL working input directory.

`(default: "" ["trident-tests/fuzz_tests/fuzzing/afl/afl_workspace/in"])`

```bash
[afl]
afl_workspace_in = ""
```

---

## `afl_workspace_out`

- AFL working output directory.

`(default: "" ["trident-tests/fuzz_tests/fuzzing/afl/afl_workspace/out"])`

```bash
[afl]
afl_workspace_out = ""
```

---

## `seeds`

- Predefined inputs to the AFL. You can specify multiple input seeds.

!!! warning "Seed Generation Priority"
    `bytes_count` has precedence before `seed`, in that case if both are specified. Seed is generated as random array of `bytes_count` bytes.

- `file_name`

    - Filename under which the test input is generated, the location of file is `afl_workspace_in` directory.

    `(default: "" ["trident-seed"])`

- `seed`

    - String used as seed.

    `(default: "" ["trident"])`

- `override_file`

    - If the file already exists at specific location, select if override.

    `(default: false)`

- `bytes_count`

    - Number of randomly generated bytes.

```bash
[[afl.seeds]]
file_name = ""
seed = ""
override_file = true
bytes_count = 20
```
