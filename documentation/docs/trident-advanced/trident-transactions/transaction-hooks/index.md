# Transaction Methods

Trident supports customizing transaction behavior with `Transaction Hooks`.

- [Pre-Transaction Execution](pre-post-execution.md): Perform custom logic before transaction execution
- [Post-Transaction Execution](pre-post-execution.md): Perform custom logic after transaction execution
- [Transaction Invariants](invariant-check.md): Validate transaction-specific invariants
- [Transaction Error Handling](error-handler.md): Handle transaction errors
- [Typed Accounts](typed-accounts.md): Deserialize accounts into typed data to perform differential analysis
