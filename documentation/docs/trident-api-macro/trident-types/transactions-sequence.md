# TransactionsSequence

Transactions sequences are a way to group transactions together. They are useful when you want to fuzz test a sequence of transactions, or when you want to fuzz test a transaction that depends on the previous one. Check out [Transaction Flows](../../trident-advanced/trident-transactions/trident-fuzzing-flows/index.md) to learn more.
